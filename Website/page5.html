At that time, I supported Clint’s business by working as his accountant. I also worked full time as a human resource/benefits manager for another company. I received my insurance license in 2009. In 2011, I started to work full time for Barrett Insurance.
<br>
<br>I was born and raised in Flint, Michigan. After I graduated from Flint Central High School, I attended Michigan State University where I received a bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts. Clint and I have a beautiful daughter who also graduated from Michigan State University with a degree in Packaging. She is currently the Senior Packaging Engineer for a company in Elk Grove, Illinois.
<br>
<br>I enjoy kayaking, photography, working in my beautiful yard, and reading. Most of all, I love to travel. My goal is to see all of the national parks.</p>

The lesson in “southern hospitality” has shaped who I am and everything that I stand for. We were taught to respect our elders, to put your best foot forward, and to be kind and caring to the people who influence your life.
<br>
<br>I graduated from Hudson High school. I attended Jackson Business College to earn a diploma in Office Accounting. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Management and Human Resources from Spring Arbor University.
<br>
<br>I have 8 years of retail management experience and 26 years in the insurance industry.
<br>
<br>I married my husband Jim 22 years ago. We have 4 grown children and 3 wonderful grand “boys!” We enjoy spending time together in the great outdoors…gardening, fishing, hunting, target shooting, and playing with our 4 dogs.
<br>
<br>In 2010, I received the horrible news that I had breast cancer. I AM A SURVIVOR!
<br>
<br>I came to Barrett Insurance in 2008 with the belief that insurance is more than just a job. It’s about building long-term relationships and helping people. Bad things happen to good people. Insurance is about making you whole again. Barrett Insurance is not just any agency. My coworkers genuinely care about making a difference. Our work is about “Protecting your dreams”- and I’d like to help.</p>

I felt the need to move into a career that would allow me to do some real good. I earned my first insurance license in 2010. I specialize in health, life, and disability insurance. In 2016, I joined the Hillsdale Rotary Club, which makes a difference in our community.
<br>
<br>I have a degree in Music. I studied and performed opera for a few years before I decided I needed to stop traveling so frequently. I still perform once in a while. I also continue to teach voice in my spare time, as I have done for years. I enjoy spending time with my family. My beautiful wife, DeAnna, is a wonderful singer and director. My daughter, Bella, is off to college challenging her mind.
<br>
<br>I moved to Hillsdale County in 1999 when my wife began teaching at Jonesville High School. We moved here from Lenawee County. I grew up in the Irish Hills area. DeAnna and I currently live in the sleepy little town of Reading, Michigan.</p>

I was born in Sturgis but I grew up in Hillsdale before moving for a number of years to Florida. I have 18 years of experience in the insurance industry. My favorite part of working in insurance is helping the client see what they need to protect their dreams. A lot of us underestimate the value of those things we should protect. I’m excited to join the Barrett Insurance team because I am dedicated to making sure my clients are taken care of and that requires we talk about it. I joined Barrett Insurance, April, 2016. My husband and I have 4 kids, 9 grandchildren, dogs, cats, granddogs, and grandcats. In my free time, I enjoy riding my motorcycle, NASCAR (Jimmie Johnson #48!), reading, swimming, and camping. I am a member of ABATE of Michigan, St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital Charity Committee, and I served as former chaplain for the Fraternal Order of Eagles.</p>

I earned my degree in Elementary Education at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. I decided to change careers after a kindergartner accidentally shot me in the foot during ‘Show and Tell!’ I joined the insurance industry in 2003.
<br>
<br>I take the time to explain the best coverage for your money and make sure you understand your policy before you leave our office. I enjoy the challenge of finding the perfect policy to protect you and your dreams from life's unexpected events.
<br>
<br>I like gardening, reading, and candy-making during the holiday seasons. I married my husband, Tracy, in 1992. We live in Jonesville with our 3 fur kids. Tracy and I have 2 dogs and a cat. We enjoy working in our yard and in our veggie garden. Specifically, I enjoy working in the yard. I force my husband to do the grunt work. He would rather be in our woods hunting or on the lake fishing. When I go fishing, I take my book and enjoy the sunshine.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">I was born in Buffalo New York, where I began my insurance career. I describe myself as a, “commercial insurance geek.”
<br>
<br>My professional insurance career began in 1970 as a commercial insurance rater after a 4 year enlistment with the Navy. I soon moved into commercial insurance underwriting. The function of an underwriter is to analyze and price business accounts with the objective of making a profit. Once the economics of centralization and downsizing began, I moved to Columbus, Ohio where I worked for Transamerica. I managed a small department before moving to USF&amp;G where I became a Contractor Segment Specialist. I worked with several contractors who built Jacob Field! From Columbus, I moved to Bloomington, Indiana and Great West Casualty – a company that specialized in long haul trucking. I completed my career as an in-house commercial lines specialist with a local agency.
<br>
<br>Clint invited me to join his staff in July 2014. Although retirement is excellent and I was never bored, I decided to return to work on a limited basis. I wanted to do something tangible with the many years I invested working very hard and learning how the industry works. I decided to use what I learned to help business people with their insurance programs. The years spent with insurance companies provide me with insider knowledge as to how they work and what they do. Before computers, we hand-rated all policies. I know policy rating in detail. My experience allows me to analyze risk and estimate a fair premium. I actually read and study insurance policy forms. I compare what they say to what they should say to offer you the best protection. Regardless of how much your insurance premium is, the value of your investment is found within those 50-200 pages of policy forms and conditions which very few people review.
<br>
<br>Briefly, I married my wife, Cindy, more than 30 years ago. We raised 5 kids and now, we like spoiling our 5 grandkids. I enjoy the outdoors. I have a constant companion in Holly, my Australian Shepard. I also take great care of three awesome horses.</p>
